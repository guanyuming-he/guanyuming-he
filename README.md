## Current status: MSc student.

## My PGP key
You may find my OpenPGP public key published [here](https://github.com/guanyuming-he/Openpgp-key) useful. 
I don't know which email address I will use in the future, but you can always (in the next 10 years, to be cautious) trust the signatures made by my private key,
if you know me and you are confident that this GitHub account is controlled by myself.

## Current Interests
*The below may seem very broad together, but they are closely connected: the subfields I listed inside the parentheses intersect each other a lot.*

1. Cybersecurity (cryptography, secure systems engineering, and in general security engineering)
2. Mathematics (mathematical logic, and very recently, elementary number theory)
3. Theoretical computer science (type theory, proof assistants, computability)
4. Computer systems (operating systems, secure systems, large software systems)
5. Software engineering (software construction, software design and architecture, free software)
6. Artificall Intelligence (it's not just about deep learning and LLMs; it's about general systems that we make to imitate (or one can argue, create) intelligence)
7. High performance computing (low level optimizations, parallel computing)

## Previous Interests
- Computer graphics
- Video games design, and human-computer interaction
