    abstract = {Twenty years ago, law enforcement organizations lobbied to require data and communication services to engineer their products to guarantee law enforcement access to all data. After lengthy debate and vigorous predictions of enforcement channels “going dark,” these attempts to regulate security technologies on the emerging Internet were abandoned. In the intervening years, innovation on the Internet flourished, and law enforcement agencies found new and more effective means of accessing vastly larger quantities of data. Today, there are again calls for regulation to mandate the provision of exceptional access mechanisms. In this article, a group of computer scientists and security experts, many of whom participated in a 1997 study of these same topics, has convened to explore the likely effects of imposing extraordinary access mandates.We have found that the damage that could be caused by law enforcement exceptional access requirements would be even greater today than it would have been 20 years ago. In the wake of the growing economic and social cost of the fundamental insecurity of today’s Internet environment, any proposals that alter the security dynamics online should be approached with caution. Exceptional access would force Internet system developers to reverse “forward secrecy” design practices that seek to minimize the impact on user privacy when systems are breached. The complexity of today’s Internet environment, with millions of apps and globally connected services, means that new law enforcement requirements are likely to introduce unanticipated, hard to detect security flaws. Beyond these and other technical vulnerabilities, the prospect of globally deployed exceptional access systems raises difficult problems about how such an environment would be governed and how to ensure that such systems would respect human rights and the rule of law.},

    abstract = {Our increasing reliance on digital technology for personal, economic, and government affairs has made it essential to secure the communications and devices of private citizens, businesses, and governments. This has led to pervasive use of cryptography across society. Despite its evident advantages, law enforcement and national security agencies have argued that the spread of cryptography has hindered access to evidence and intelligence. Some in industry and government now advocate a new technology to access targeted data: client-side scanning (CSS). Instead of weakening encryption or providing law enforcement with backdoor keys to decrypt communications, CSS would enable on-device analysis of data in the clear. If targeted information were detected, its existence and, potentially, its source would be revealed to the agencies; otherwise, little or no information would leave the client device. Its proponents claim that CSS is a solution to the encryption versus public safety debate: it offers privacy—in the sense of unimpeded end-to-end encryption—and the ability to successfully investigate serious crime. In this paper, we argue that CSS neither guarantees efficacious crime prevention nor prevents surveillance. Indeed, the effect is the opposite. CSS by its nature creates serious security and privacy risks for all society, while the assistance it can provide for law enforcement is at best problematic. There are multiple ways in which CSS can fail, can be evaded, and can be abused.},

The introduction of HTTP/3 (HTTP over QUIC) yields promising expectations to counteract such interference, due to its novelty, build-in encryption, and faster connection establishment. To evaluate this hypothesis and analyze the current state of HTTP/3 blocking, we extended the open-source censorship measurement-tool OONI with an HTTP/3 module. Using an input list of possibly-blocked websites, real-world measurements with HTTPS and HTTP/3 were conducted in selected Autonomous Systems in China, Iran, India, and Kazakhstan. The presented evaluation assesses the different blocking methodologies employed for TCP/TLS versus the ones employed for QUIC. The results reveal dedicated UDP blocking in Iran and major IP blocklisting affecting QUIC in China and India.},

This probing works by passively monitoring the network for suspicious traffic, then actively probing the corresponding servers, and blocking any that are determined to run circumvention servers such as Tor.We draw upon multiple forms of measurements, some spanning years, to illuminate the nature of this probing. We identify the different types of probing, develop fingerprinting techniques to infer the physical structure of the system, localize the sensors that trigger probing---showing that they differ from the "Great Firewall" infrastructure---and assess probing's efficacy in blocking different versions of Tor. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for designing circumvention servers that resist such probing mechanisms.},

The reports have sparked an intense and wide-ranging policy debate on network neutrality and ISP traffic management practices. However, to date, end users lack access to measurement tools that can detect whether their access ISPs are blocking their BitTorrent traffic. And since ISPs do not voluntarily disclose their traffic management policies, no one knows how widely BitTorrent traffic blocking is deployed in the current Internet. In this paper, we address this problem by designing an easy-to-use tool to detect BitTorrent blocking and by presenting results from a widely used public deployment of the tool.},

			replicate content at thousands of servers worldwide in an attempt
			to bring it closer to end users. Recent years have, however,
			brought a surge of peer-to-peer (p2p) systems that have
			demonstrated the ability both to help traditional CDN operations
			and to effectively disseminate content as independent applications.
			Unfortunately, this p2p surge has created significant problems to
			network operators by generating large volumes of inter-AS traffic.
			In this paper, we demonstrate that stepping back and applying
			traditional CDN design principles to p2p systems can help solve
			these emerging problems. In particular, focusing on the BitTorrent
			swarming protocol, we show that our new service model can, in the
			common case, reduce inter-AS traffic by 45–75\%. Moreover, in
			scenarios when ISPs are shaping inter-AS traffic, it speeds up
			download times by 60\% for the most popular torrents. Our approach
			bases on disproving the common wisdom that the current peer
			altruism in p2p systems (BitTorrent in particular) is insufficient.
			We thus abandon the common approach of deploying novel incentives
			for cooperation, and focus on designing methods to effectively
			utilize existing system resources. We show that controlled
			regional-based content replication, common for the traditional CDN
			design, can effectively achieve this goal. We implement our system
			and demonstrate that it effectively scales. Moreover, it is
			incrementally deployable and brings significant benefits in partial
			deployment scenarios. ISPs and network regions in which the system
			gets deployed can resolve their inter-AS traffic problems instantly
			and autonomously, i.e., without any inter-ISP collaboration and
			without requiring that the system gets deployed in the entire
			Internet.}

abstract="Network oversubscription has long been used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs). While high oversubscription ratios can hamper the end user experience, low oversubscription rates may result in an under-utilization of resources. This paper investigates the impacts of oversubscription, both from a technical (OpEx, Energy footprint etc.) and from a value network point of view (Control and Value creation etc.). A multi-parameter sensitivity analysis of a power model is performed to establish that the choice of oversubscription ratio by an ISP can have a serious impact on their operational energy and capital expenditures. As a next step, a set of business model parameters are operationalized in order to evaluate and establish long-term and short-term impacts of network oversubscription on business stakeholders. Key findings include that there is a need to establish a fit between the technical and business gains of network oversubscription, and that is possible only when an ISP leverages its control and influence over its customer base to better understand and anticipate the network usage, thereby being able to promptly adapting the overall network oversubscription ratios.",

    abstract = { Should a firm charge on a per-use basis or sell subscriptions when its service experiences congestion? Queueing-based models of pricing primarily focus on charging a fee per use for the service, in part because per-use pricing enables the firm to regulate congestion—raising the per-use price naturally reduces how frequently customers use a service. The firm has less control over usage with subscription pricing (by definition, with subscription pricing customers are not charged proportional to their actual usage), and this is a disadvantage when customers dislike congestion. However, we show that subscription pricing is more effective at earning revenue. Consequently, the firm may be better off with subscription pricing, even, surprisingly, when congestion is intuitively most problematic for the firm: e.g., as congestion becomes more disliked by consumers. We show that the absolute advantage of subscription pricing relative to per-use pricing can be substantial, whereas the potential advantage of per-use pricing is generally modest. Subscription pricing becomes relatively more attractive if consumers become more heterogeneous in their service rates (e.g., some know they are “heavy” users and others know they are “light” users) as long as capacity is fixed, the potential utilization is high, and the two segments have substantially different usage rates. Otherwise, heterogeneity in usage rates makes subscription pricing less attractive relative to per-use pricing. We conclude that subscription pricing can be effective even if congestion is relevant for the overall quality of a service. }

abstract="Many computers emit a high-pitched noise during operation, due to vibration in some of their electronic components. These acoustic emanations are more than a nuisance: as we show in this paper, they can leak the key used in cryptographic operations. This is surprising, since the acoustic information has very low bandwidth (under 20 kHz using common microphones, and a few hundred kHz using ultrasound microphones), which is many orders of magnitude below the GHz-scale clock rates of the attacked computers. We describe a new acoustic cryptanalysis attack which can extract full 4096-bit RSA keys from the popular GnuPG software, within an hour, using the sound generated by the computer during the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts. We experimentally demonstrate such attacks, using a plain mobile phone placed next to the computer, or a more sensitive microphone placed 10 meters away.",

abstract = {An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intented recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be “signed” using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in “electronic mail” and “electronic funds transfer” systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d ≡ 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.},

abstract = {We propose a fully homomorphic encryption scheme -- i.e., a scheme that allows one to evaluate circuits over encrypted data without being able to decrypt. Our solution comes in three steps. First, we provide a general result -- that, to construct an encryption scheme that permits evaluation of arbitrary circuits, it suffices to construct an encryption scheme that can evaluate (slightly augmented versions of) its own decryption circuit; we call a scheme that can evaluate its (augmented) decryption circuit bootstrappable.Next, we describe a public key encryption scheme using ideal lattices that is almost bootstrappable.Lattice-based cryptosystems typically have decryption algorithms with low circuit complexity, often dominated by an inner product computation that is in NC1. Also, ideal lattices provide both additive and multiplicative homomorphisms (modulo a public-key ideal in a polynomial ring that is represented as a lattice), as needed to evaluate general circuits.Unfortunately, our initial scheme is not quite bootstrappable -- i.e., the depth that the scheme can correctly evaluate can be logarithmic in the lattice dimension, just like the depth of the decryption circuit, but the latter is greater than the former. In the final step, we show how to modify the scheme to reduce the depth of the decryption circuit, and thereby obtain a bootstrappable encryption scheme, without reducing the depth that the scheme can evaluate. Abstractly, we accomplish this by enabling the encrypter to start the decryption process, leaving less work for the decrypter, much like the server leaves less work for the decrypter in a server-aided cryptosystem.},

abstract = {Modern processors use branch prediction and speculative execution to maximize performance. For example, if the destination of a branch depends on a memory value that is in the process of being read, CPUs will try to guess the destination and attempt to execute ahead. When the memory value finally arrives, the CPU either discards or commits the speculative computation. Speculative logic is unfaithful in how it executes, can access the victim's memory and registers, and can perform operations with measurable side effects.Spectre attacks involve inducing a victim to speculatively perform operations that would not occur during correct program execution and which leak the victim's confidential information via a side channel to the adversary. This paper describes practical attacks that combine methodology from side-channel attacks, fault attacks, and return-oriented programming that can read arbitrary memory from the victim's process. More broadly, the paper shows that speculative execution implementations violate the security assumptions underpinning numerous software security mechanisms, such as operating system process separation, containerization, just-in-time (JIT) compilation, and countermeasures to cache timing and side-channel attacks. These attacks represent a serious threat to actual systems because vulnerable speculative execution capabilities are found in microprocessors from Intel, AMD, and ARM that are used in billions of devices.Although makeshift processor-specific countermeasures are possible in some cases, sound solutions will require fixes to processor designs as well as updates to instruction set architectures (ISAs) to give hardware architects and software developers a common understanding as to what computation state CPU implementations are (and are not) permitted to leak.},

Hierarchy allows the use of type families, in which higher level supertypes capture the behavior that all of their subtypes have in common. For this methodology to be effective, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of how subtypes and supertypes are related. This paper takes the position that the relationship should ensure that any property proved about supertype objects also holds for its subtype objects. It presents two ways of defining the subtype relation, each of which meets this criterion, and each of which is easy for programmers to use. The subtype relation is based on the specifications of the sub- and supertypes; the paper presents a way of specifying types that makes it convenient to define  the subtype relation. The paper also discusses the ramifications of this notion of subtyping on the design of type families.},

abstract = {In the Open Source Software (OSS) paradigm, developers along with users form a community for an OSS project as they share an interest in using/developing the project. Active community engagement is essential for an OSS project to succeed. OSS communities should strive for greater community participation and engagement through the use of tools, practices, and processes. The primary goal of this paper is to presents a review of studies on community participation and engagement in OSS projects based on systematic mapping study and snowballing technique. This study also provides an understanding about the research topics and gaps in the area, utilized research methods and publication venues. We have analyzed 67 research papers related to the study topic. The findings revealed that most of the studies used a combination of survey and questionnaire as a research methodology. We found that community participation and engagement research focuses on 5 main research topics joining process, contribution barriers, motivation, retention, and abandonment. The investigated studies provide more evidence on motivation and contribution barriers but less on the joining process and abandonment. The results presented in this paper will be helpful for researchers to understand the latest trends in this area and identifying the corresponding research gaps.}

    abstract = {Encounters and interactions with cybersecurity are now regular and routine experiences for information technology users across a variety of devices, systems and services. Unfortunately, however, despite long-term recognition of the importance of usability in the technology context, the user experience of cybersecurity and privacy is by no means guaranteed to address this criterion. This paper presents an outline of usability issues and challenges in the cybersecurity context, with examples of how it has (or indeed has not) evolved in some established contexts (looking in particular at web browsing and user authentication), as well as consideration of the extent to which any better attention is apparent within more recent and emerging technology contexts (considering the presentation of related features in scenarios including app stores and smart devices). Based on the evidence, cybersecurity is clearly yet to reach a stage where its mention would naturally imply usability, but at the same time the two concepts do not have to represent a contradiction in terms. The resulting requirement is for the increasing recognition of the issue to translate into a greater level of resulting attention and action.},

ABSTRACT = {The usability/security trade-off indicates the inversely proportional relationship that seems to exist between usability and security. The more secure the systems, the less usable they will be. On the contrary, more usable systems will be less secure. So far, attempts to reduce the gap between usability and security have been unsuccessful. In this paper, we offer a theoretical perspective to exploit this tradeoff rather than fight it, as well as a practical approach to the use of contextual improvements in system usability to reward secure behavior. The theoretical perspective, based on the concept of reinforcement, has been successfully applied to several domains, and there is no reason to believe that the cybersecurity domain will represent an exception. Although the purpose of this article is to devise a research agenda, we also provide an example based on a single-case study where we apply the rationale underlying our proposal in a laboratory experiment.},

abstract = {The advent of large language models (LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges for the information retrieval (IR) community. On one hand, LLMs will revolutionize how people access information, meanwhile the retrieval techniques can play a crucial role in addressing many inherent limitations of LLMs. On the other hand, there are open problems regarding the collaboration of retrieval and generation, the potential risks of misinformation, and the concerns about cost-effectiveness. To seize the critical moment for development, it calls for the joint effort from academia and industry on many key issues, including identification of new research problems, proposal of new techniques, and creation of new evaluation protocols. It has been one year since the launch of ChatGPT in November last year, and the entire community is currently undergoing a profound transformation in techniques. Therefore, this workshop will be a timely venue to exchange ideas and forge collaborations. The organizers, committee members, and invited speakers are composed of a diverse group of researchers coming from leading institutions in the world. This event will be made up of multiple sessions, including invited talks, paper presentations, hands-on tutorials, and panel discussions. All the materials collected for this workshop will be archived and shared publicly, which will present a long-term value to the community.},

It turns out that the threat model commonly used by cryptosystem designers was wrong: most frauds were not caused by cryptanalysis or other technical attacks, but by implementation errors and management failures. This suggests that a paradigm shift is overdue in computer security; we look at some of the alternatives, and see some signs that this shift may be getting under way.},

abstract = {In security engineering, including software security engineering, there is a well-known design paradigm telling to prefer safe and secure defaults. The paper presents a systematization of knowledge (SoK) of this paradigm by the means of a systematic mapping study and a scoping review of relevant literature. According to the mapping and review, the paradigm has been extensively discussed, used, and developed further since the late 1990s. Partially driven by the insecurity of the Internet of things, the volume of publications has accelerated from the circa mid-2010s onward. The publications reviewed indicate that the paradigm has been adopted in numerous different contexts. It has also been expanded with security design principles not originally considered when the paradigm was initiated in the mid-1970s. Among the newer principles are an “off by default” principle, various overriding and fallback principles, as well as those related to the zero trust model. The review also indicates problems developers and others have faced with the paradigm.}
