    abstract = {Twenty years ago, law enforcement organizations lobbied to require data and communication services to engineer their products to guarantee law enforcement access to all data. After lengthy debate and vigorous predictions of enforcement channels “going dark,” these attempts to regulate security technologies on the emerging Internet were abandoned. In the intervening years, innovation on the Internet flourished, and law enforcement agencies found new and more effective means of accessing vastly larger quantities of data. Today, there are again calls for regulation to mandate the provision of exceptional access mechanisms. In this article, a group of computer scientists and security experts, many of whom participated in a 1997 study of these same topics, has convened to explore the likely effects of imposing extraordinary access mandates.We have found that the damage that could be caused by law enforcement exceptional access requirements would be even greater today than it would have been 20 years ago. In the wake of the growing economic and social cost of the fundamental insecurity of today’s Internet environment, any proposals that alter the security dynamics online should be approached with caution. Exceptional access would force Internet system developers to reverse “forward secrecy” design practices that seek to minimize the impact on user privacy when systems are breached. The complexity of today’s Internet environment, with millions of apps and globally connected services, means that new law enforcement requirements are likely to introduce unanticipated, hard to detect security flaws. Beyond these and other technical vulnerabilities, the prospect of globally deployed exceptional access systems raises difficult problems about how such an environment would be governed and how to ensure that such systems would respect human rights and the rule of law.},

    abstract = {Our increasing reliance on digital technology for personal, economic, and government affairs has made it essential to secure the communications and devices of private citizens, businesses, and governments. This has led to pervasive use of cryptography across society. Despite its evident advantages, law enforcement and national security agencies have argued that the spread of cryptography has hindered access to evidence and intelligence. Some in industry and government now advocate a new technology to access targeted data: client-side scanning (CSS). Instead of weakening encryption or providing law enforcement with backdoor keys to decrypt communications, CSS would enable on-device analysis of data in the clear. If targeted information were detected, its existence and, potentially, its source would be revealed to the agencies; otherwise, little or no information would leave the client device. Its proponents claim that CSS is a solution to the encryption versus public safety debate: it offers privacy—in the sense of unimpeded end-to-end encryption—and the ability to successfully investigate serious crime. In this paper, we argue that CSS neither guarantees efficacious crime prevention nor prevents surveillance. Indeed, the effect is the opposite. CSS by its nature creates serious security and privacy risks for all society, while the assistance it can provide for law enforcement is at best problematic. There are multiple ways in which CSS can fail, can be evaded, and can be abused.},

The introduction of HTTP/3 (HTTP over QUIC) yields promising expectations to counteract such interference, due to its novelty, build-in encryption, and faster connection establishment. To evaluate this hypothesis and analyze the current state of HTTP/3 blocking, we extended the open-source censorship measurement-tool OONI with an HTTP/3 module. Using an input list of possibly-blocked websites, real-world measurements with HTTPS and HTTP/3 were conducted in selected Autonomous Systems in China, Iran, India, and Kazakhstan. The presented evaluation assesses the different blocking methodologies employed for TCP/TLS versus the ones employed for QUIC. The results reveal dedicated UDP blocking in Iran and major IP blocklisting affecting QUIC in China and India.},

This probing works by passively monitoring the network for suspicious traffic, then actively probing the corresponding servers, and blocking any that are determined to run circumvention servers such as Tor.We draw upon multiple forms of measurements, some spanning years, to illuminate the nature of this probing. We identify the different types of probing, develop fingerprinting techniques to infer the physical structure of the system, localize the sensors that trigger probing---showing that they differ from the "Great Firewall" infrastructure---and assess probing's efficacy in blocking different versions of Tor. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for designing circumvention servers that resist such probing mechanisms.},

The reports have sparked an intense and wide-ranging policy debate on network neutrality and ISP traffic management practices. However, to date, end users lack access to measurement tools that can detect whether their access ISPs are blocking their BitTorrent traffic. And since ISPs do not voluntarily disclose their traffic management policies, no one knows how widely BitTorrent traffic blocking is deployed in the current Internet. In this paper, we address this problem by designing an easy-to-use tool to detect BitTorrent blocking and by presenting results from a widely used public deployment of the tool.},

			replicate content at thousands of servers worldwide in an attempt
			to bring it closer to end users. Recent years have, however,
			brought a surge of peer-to-peer (p2p) systems that have
			demonstrated the ability both to help traditional CDN operations
			and to effectively disseminate content as independent applications.
			Unfortunately, this p2p surge has created significant problems to
			network operators by generating large volumes of inter-AS traffic.
			In this paper, we demonstrate that stepping back and applying
			traditional CDN design principles to p2p systems can help solve
			these emerging problems. In particular, focusing on the BitTorrent
			swarming protocol, we show that our new service model can, in the
			common case, reduce inter-AS traffic by 45–75\%. Moreover, in
			scenarios when ISPs are shaping inter-AS traffic, it speeds up
			download times by 60\% for the most popular torrents. Our approach
			bases on disproving the common wisdom that the current peer
			altruism in p2p systems (BitTorrent in particular) is insufficient.
			We thus abandon the common approach of deploying novel incentives
			for cooperation, and focus on designing methods to effectively
			utilize existing system resources. We show that controlled
			regional-based content replication, common for the traditional CDN
			design, can effectively achieve this goal. We implement our system
			and demonstrate that it effectively scales. Moreover, it is
			incrementally deployable and brings significant benefits in partial
			deployment scenarios. ISPs and network regions in which the system
			gets deployed can resolve their inter-AS traffic problems instantly
			and autonomously, i.e., without any inter-ISP collaboration and
			without requiring that the system gets deployed in the entire
			Internet.}

abstract="Network oversubscription has long been used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs). While high oversubscription ratios can hamper the end user experience, low oversubscription rates may result in an under-utilization of resources. This paper investigates the impacts of oversubscription, both from a technical (OpEx, Energy footprint etc.) and from a value network point of view (Control and Value creation etc.). A multi-parameter sensitivity analysis of a power model is performed to establish that the choice of oversubscription ratio by an ISP can have a serious impact on their operational energy and capital expenditures. As a next step, a set of business model parameters are operationalized in order to evaluate and establish long-term and short-term impacts of network oversubscription on business stakeholders. Key findings include that there is a need to establish a fit between the technical and business gains of network oversubscription, and that is possible only when an ISP leverages its control and influence over its customer base to better understand and anticipate the network usage, thereby being able to promptly adapting the overall network oversubscription ratios.",

    abstract = { Should a firm charge on a per-use basis or sell subscriptions when its service experiences congestion? Queueing-based models of pricing primarily focus on charging a fee per use for the service, in part because per-use pricing enables the firm to regulate congestion—raising the per-use price naturally reduces how frequently customers use a service. The firm has less control over usage with subscription pricing (by definition, with subscription pricing customers are not charged proportional to their actual usage), and this is a disadvantage when customers dislike congestion. However, we show that subscription pricing is more effective at earning revenue. Consequently, the firm may be better off with subscription pricing, even, surprisingly, when congestion is intuitively most problematic for the firm: e.g., as congestion becomes more disliked by consumers. We show that the absolute advantage of subscription pricing relative to per-use pricing can be substantial, whereas the potential advantage of per-use pricing is generally modest. Subscription pricing becomes relatively more attractive if consumers become more heterogeneous in their service rates (e.g., some know they are “heavy” users and others know they are “light” users) as long as capacity is fixed, the potential utilization is high, and the two segments have substantially different usage rates. Otherwise, heterogeneity in usage rates makes subscription pricing less attractive relative to per-use pricing. We conclude that subscription pricing can be effective even if congestion is relevant for the overall quality of a service. }

	abstract = { Advances in network equipment now allow internet service
			 providers to monitor the content of data packets in real-time and
			 make decisions about how to handle them. If deployed widely this
			 technology, known as deep packet inspection (DPI), has the
			 potential to alter basic assumptions that have underpinned
			 internet governance to date. The article explores the way internet
			 governance is responding to deep packet inspection and the
			 political struggles around it. Avoiding the extremes of
			 technological determinism and social constructivism, it integrates
			 theoretical approaches from the sociology of technology and
			 actor-centered institutionalism into a new framework for
			 technology-aware policy analysis. }
